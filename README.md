## **Overview**  
Airlines operate in a highly competitive market where retaining existing customers and acquiring new ones are critical for growth. This project focuses on solving one such challenge: predicting whether a referred passenger will book a flight. Using machine learning classification techniques, we analyzed historical passenger data to uncover the key drivers behind successful referrals.  

The results from this project empowered airlines to:  
- Improve their referral success rate by targeting high-potential customers.  
- Enhance customer satisfaction by addressing specific service gaps.  
- Drive long-term growth through data-informed decision-making.  


## **Objective**  
The primary objectives were:  
1. To build a robust classification model to predict referred passenger bookings.  
2. To provide actionable insights into what influences customer recommendations and referral success.  
3. To identify service areas for improvement based on data trends and customer behavior.


## **Dataset Summary**  
The dataset contains **131,895 entries** from airline reviews (2016â€“2019). It includes passenger ratings, travel details, and review text.  

### **Key Features**  
- **Customer Experience**: Seat Comfort, Cabin Service, Food & Beverage, Entertainment, Ground Service.  
- **Demographics**: Traveler Type (Solo, Couple, Family), Travel Class (Economy, Business, etc.).  
- **Flight Details**: Airline, Aircraft, Route, Date Flown.  
- **Target Variable**: Recommendation (whether the passenger recommended the airline to others).  

### **Notable Observations from Data Exploration**  
- **Traveler Type Distribution**:  
  - **37%** were solo travelers (key for referrals).  
  - **28%** traveled as couples, with higher satisfaction ratings.

### **1. Data Ingestion and Cleaning**  
- **Input**: CSV dataset loaded using Pandas.  
- **Cleaning Steps**:  
  - Removed rows with missing values in critical features (e.g., Overall Rating).  
  - Imputed values where feasible (e.g., median rating for cabin service).  
  - Extracted useful features from text-based reviews (e.g., sentiment score).  

**Why Remove Missing Values?**  
Critical features like "Overall Rating" and "Value for Money" are strong predictors of customer satisfaction. Retaining incomplete rows could introduce noise and bias into the model, reducing prediction accuracy.  



### **2. Feature Engineering and Selection**  
- **One-Hot Encoding**: Encoded categorical variables like "Traveler Type" and "Cabin Class."  
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Processed free-text reviews to extract sentiments using TF-IDF vectorization.  
- **Feature Selection**: Retained features with high correlation to the target variable.  

**Key Features Identified**:  
1. Overall Rating  
2. Value for Money  
3. Seat Comfort  
4. Cabin Service  
5. Food & Beverage  

These features emerged as the most influential in determining referrals based on their weights in the Logistic Regression model and feature importance in ensemble models like Random Forest.


### **3. Model Development**  
We explored multiple classification algorithms to identify the best fit:  

#### **Models Evaluated**  
1. **Logistic Regression**  
   - Pros: Highly interpretable, fast, and effective for linearly separable data.  
   - Result: Delivered **~90% accuracy** with proper regularization to avoid overfitting.  
2. **Random Forest**  
   - Pros: Robust against overfitting; provides feature importance.  
   - Result: Marginally higher accuracy but computationally expensive.  
3. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**  
   - Pros: Effective for high-dimensional data.  
   - Result: Slightly better accuracy than Logistic Regression but slower inference.  
4. **Decision Tree**  
   - Pros: Simple and interpretable.  
   - Result: Prone to overfitting; less effective on this dataset.  
5. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  
   - Result: Performed poorly due to high dimensionality.  


**Why Logistic Regression?**  
- Logistic Regression outperformed other models in terms of interpretability and training efficiency.  
- Regularization (L2 penalty) helped handle multicollinearity and improved generalization.  
- Despite SVM's marginally better accuracy, its higher computational cost made it less practical for production deployment.  



### **4. Model Evaluation and Hyperparameter Tuning**  
- **Cross-Validation**: Used Stratified K-Fold to ensure balanced class representation.  
- **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Grid Search tuned hyperparameters like regularization strength for Logistic Regression and tree depth for Random Forest.  

#### **Final Model Performance**  
- Logistic Regression achieved:  
  - Accuracy: **90%**  
  - F1-Score: **0.89**  
- Insights from coefficients confirmed the importance of "Overall Rating" and "Value for Money."
